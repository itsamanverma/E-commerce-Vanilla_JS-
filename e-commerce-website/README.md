# E-commerce Website 

### This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the MEAN stack. The application loads products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart

# Important Folder

### I have included a Two folder in this repo. Inside that folder will be 2 folders called client and server. These 2 folders contain a Forntend Stucture that I use in this ecommerce user Interface. You can use the server ecommerce database & bankend parts.
